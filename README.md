# Fake-News-Classifier

For this project, I used Naive Bayes and KNN models to build a classifier that could distinguish between fake news and real news in the data set I used. 

## Accuracy levels:

Naive Bayes: ~88%

KNN Model: ~67%

## Conclusion

Although decent results were achieved, there could have been better accuracies achieved if data preprocessing would have been done before using the models.
